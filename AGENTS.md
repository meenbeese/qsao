Case Requirements
1. Team Analysis
Evaluate your assigned MLB team’s 40-man and 26-man rosters, analyzing players based on:
● Position and role (Starter, Reliever, Everyday Player, Platoon Player, Prospect, etc)
● Age and Career Trajectory
● Recent performance and underlying metrics
● Contract status (pre-arbitration, arbitration-eligible, long-term extension)
Identify:
● Core roster strengths and competitive advantages
● Roster weaknesses and inefficiencies
● Positional depth issues at the MLB and upper-minor league (AAA and AA) levels
Assess the team’s competitive window ( rebuilding, retooling, or contending) and compare their
performance and roster construction to:
● League averages
● Division rivals
● Recent playoff teams
2. Player Evaluation Models
Construct an analytics based framework to evaluate players in alignment with team needs. This
may include:
- A quantitative model (WAR-based valuation, run-creation or run-prevention metrics)
- An archetype-based framework (e.g, high-OBP leadoff hitters, ground-ball relievers,
power-contact balance)
Your framework should:
● Incorporate both traditional and advanced metrics
● Adjust for positional value and defensive impact
● Account for age curves and expected development / decline
Groups are recommended to create 1 to 2 machine learning models to accomplish this task.
Clearly explain why the metrics you highlight in your model / framework are appropriate for
your team’s strategic direction.
3. Roster Optimization and Contract Decisions
Focus on internal decision making, including but not limited to:
● Identify players approaching arbitration who should be:
○ Extended early
○ Traded at peak value
○ Have their contracts extensions run year-to-year
● Evaluate underperforming players and determine whether they should remain part of the
team’s long-term plan
● Assess top prospects and deciding:
○ Which players should be promoted to / given more playing time the majors
○ Which players are expendable in trades
○ Which players should be developed internally due to positional scarcity
● Any other internal changes you recommend the team should make
○ Ex. changing a player / prospects position, reducing or increasing a player’s
playing time, changing the team’s batting order, etc
4. Trade Proposals
Propose two realistic, analytics-backed trades that advances your team’s strategic direction.
Your trade proposals must:
● Include only players in the organization (no draft picks or international signing bonus
pool money)
● Be positionally and competitively realistic for both teams
● Be justified using your player evaluation model / framework
You must explain:
● Why the acquired player(s) fit your team’s needs
● Why the outgoing player(s) are surplus to requirements and are realistic targets for the
team you are sending them to
● How the trade impacts your team’s short and long-term outlook
