WAR (Wins Above Replacement):\n   \u2022 Holistic measure of pitcher value\n   \u2022 Accounts for all aspects of pitching performance\n   \u2022 Industry standard for comparing players across positions\n   \n2. ERA (Earned Run Average):\n   \u2022 Primary indicator of pitching effectiveness\n   \u2022 Adjusted for league environment (ERA+)\n   \u2022 Key predictor of future success\n   \n3. IP (Innings Pitched):\n   \u2022 Volume metric indicating durability\n   \u2022 Separates starters from relievers\n   \u2022 Shows availability and trust from management\n   \n4. Age/Development Curve:\n   \u2022 Pitchers peak typically 28-32 years old\n   \u2022 Young pitchers (\u226426) have high variance\n   \u2022 Aging curve critical for contract decisions\n   \n5. Saves/Role Metrics:\n   \u2022 Identifies specialized closers\n   \u2022 Reliever usage patterns\n   \u2022 Long-term roster construction needs\n        "
